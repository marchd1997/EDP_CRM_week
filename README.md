# Volumetric Risk Management for Renewable Energy

Renewable energy productionis highly weather-dependent, making output volumes unpredictable. While price risk can be hedged through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), **volumetric risk** remains a major source of revenue uncertainty for asset owners.

This project explores tools and strategies to better **understand, quantify, and manage volumetric risk**, particularly for wind power producers in electricity markets.
